# gh-pr-upsert

Upsert GitHub pull requests.

`gh-pr-upsert` creates or updates a GitHub pull request (PR) with the commits
on your current branch:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/$YOUR_OWNER/$YOUR_REPO.git
$ cd $YOUR_REPO
$ git switch -c $YOUR_BRANCH
$ echo $YOUR_CHANGES >> README.md
$ git commit README.md --message "$YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
$ gh-pr-upsert --title "$YOUR_PR_TITLE" --body "$YOUR_PR_BODY"
https://github.com/<YOUR_OWNER>/<YOUR_REPO>/pull/1
```

See `gh-pr-upsert --help` for command line options.

If a PR for `$YOUR_BRANCH` already exists then it'll be updated by
force-pushing.

If there are no changes on `$YOUR_BRANCH` compared to the base branch then any
existing PR for `$YOUR_BRANCH` will be closed: the PR apparently isn't needed
anymore.

`gh-pr-upsert` won't force-push any branches or close any PRs that contain
commits from anyone other than the current user (as reported by
`git config --get user.name` and `git config --get user.email`).

Requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
to be installed.

## Installing

We recommend using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install
gh-pr-upsert.
First [install pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/#install-pipx) then run:

```terminal
pipx install git+https://github.com/hypothesis/gh-pr-upsert.git
```

You now have gh-pr-upsert installed! For some help run:

```
gh-pr-upsert --help
```

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version run:

```terminal
pipx upgrade gh-pr-upsert
```

To see what version you have run:

```terminal
gh-pr-upsert --version
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall run:

```
pipx uninstall gh-pr-upsert
```

## Setting up Your gh-pr-upsert Development Environment

First you'll need to install:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
  On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git`, on macOS: `brew install git`.
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
  This is probably already installed, run `make --version` to check.
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
  Follow the instructions in pyenv's README to install it.
  The **Homebrew** method works best on macOS.
  The **Basic GitHub Checkout** method works best on Ubuntu.
  You _don't_ need to set up pyenv's shell integration ("shims"), you can
  [use pyenv without shims](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#using-pyenv-without-shims).

Then to set up your development environment:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/hypothesis/gh-pr-upsert.git
cd gh-pr-upsert
make help
```

## Changing the Project's Python Versions

To change what versions of Python the project uses:

1. Change the Python versions in the
   [cookiecutter.json](.cookiecutter/cookiecutter.json) file. For example:

   ```json
   "python_versions": "3.10.4, 3.9.12",
   ```

2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:

   ```terminal
   make template
   ```

3. Commit everything to git and send a pull request

## Changing the Project's Python Dependencies

To change the production dependencies in the `setup.cfg` file:

1. Change the dependencies in the [`.cookiecutter/includes/setuptools/install_requires`](.cookiecutter/includes/setuptools/install_requires) file.
   If this file doesn't exist yet create it and add some dependencies to it.
   For example:

   ```
   pyramid
   sqlalchemy
   celery
   ```

2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:

   ```terminal
   make template
   ```

3. Commit everything to git and send a pull request

To change the project's formatting, linting and test dependencies:

1. Change the dependencies in the [`.cookiecutter/includes/tox/deps`](.cookiecutter/includes/tox/deps) file.
   If this file doesn't exist yet create it and add some dependencies to it.
   Use tox's [factor-conditional settings](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html#factors-and-factor-conditional-settings)
   to limit which environment(s) each dependency is used in.
   For example:

   ```
   lint: flake8,
   format: autopep8,
   lint,tests: pytest-faker,
   ```

2. Re-run the cookiecutter template:

   ```terminal
   make template
   ```

3. Commit everything to git and send a pull request
